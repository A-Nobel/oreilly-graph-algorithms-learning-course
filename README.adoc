You can run all the notebooks in this repository by running the following command:

[source, bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

We'll get output that contains something like this:

[source, text]
----
data-science-training-jupyter | [I 12:04:09.836 NotebookApp] JupyterLab extension loaded from /opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jupyterlab
data-science-training-jupyter | [I 12:04:09.836 NotebookApp] JupyterLab application directory is /opt/conda/share/jupyter/lab
data-science-training-jupyter | [I 12:04:09.837 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/jovyan
data-science-training-jupyter | [I 12:04:09.837 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
data-science-training-jupyter | [I 12:04:09.837 NotebookApp] http://(2c06cde3563c or 127.0.0.1):8888/?token=20927ab73fbd2b841db595d4d2d0f6a0788a550c39a1faa3

data-science-training-jupyter |     To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
data-science-training-jupyter |         file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-6-open.html
data-science-training-jupyter |     Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
data-science-training-jupyter |         http://(2c06cde3563c or 127.0.0.1):8888/?token=20927ab73fbd2b841db595d4d2d0f6a0788a550c39a1faa3
----

We can then navigate to `http://localhost:8888/?token=20927ab73fbd2b841db595d4d2d0f6a0788a550c39a1faa3`.
We'll need to update the `token=<token>` part of that URI to match our own token.
